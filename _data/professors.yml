    Jackie Chi Kit Cheung is an Assistant Professor in McGill’s School of Computer Science, where he co-directs the Reasoning and Learning Lab. He obtained his PhD from the University of Toronto and joined McGill in 2015. His research group focuses on developing computational methods for understanding text and for generating language that is fluent and appropriate to the context. Several current projects include extracting events from text, automatic summarization, and leveraging external knowledge for language understanding. Dr. Cheung is a member of the Mila Research Institute, and is an academic advisor for MSR Montreal.

  bio: |
    Prakash Panangaden is a Core academic member of Mila. Professor at the School of Computer Science at McGill University, he is interested in mathematical foundations of machine learning.  He has worked on bisimulation, metrics and approximation for Markov processes. He has also worked on logics for probabilistic systems, Stone duality for Markov processes and programming languages.  His recent activity includes a quantitative extension of equational logic and semantics for a stochastic lambda-calculus. In other recent work, he and his collaborators developed a notion of approximate minimization of weighted finite automata and bisimulation for such automata.  This has led to current activity in automata learning. Past research activities include quantum information theory, concurrent programming semantics, modal logic and category theory.

    I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at McGill University and a Core Academic Member at Mila. I also serve as co-founder and chair of Climate Change AI. My research foci are:

    - Deep learning theory: Mathematical understanding of the properties of neural networks.
    - Machine learning and climate change: Applications of machine learning to mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis.

    Previously, I was an NSF Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, working with Konrad Körding. I received my PhD in Applied Math from MIT in 2018, co-advised by Nir Shavit, Max Tegmark, and Ed Boyden. Before that, I was a Fulbright Scholar at the Freie Universität Berlin and an undergraduate at MIT.
